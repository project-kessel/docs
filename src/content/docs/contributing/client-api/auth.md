      description: |
        Object used to perform authenticated HTTP requests. 
        In languages where such constructs are already provided (e.g. python, see [1]), they should be used instead of this object to take
        advantage of the existing ecosystem.
        
        This can be created from the [OAuth2ClientCredentials](#class-OAuth2ClientCredentials) Object by using [oauth2AuthRequest](#functions-oAuth2AuthRequest).

            Configures the HTTP request as needed to use a specific authorization type.
            This method allows adopters to implement a specific authorization type depending their environment.

        Credentials class implementing the OAuth 2.0 *Client Credentials* grant.
        Retrieves and refreshes access tokens from a **direct** OAuth 2.0 token
        endpoint (`token_url`) using the *Client Credentials* grant.

          description: |
            Obtains a valid token for the client. If `forceRefresh` is set to `true`, a new token is
            fetched and cached regardless of the current tokenâ€™s expiry. The cached token
            is returned when it does not expire in the next 5 minutes (300 seconds). Otherwise, a 
            new one is fetched and cached. 

            Implementations must be thread-safe.

The `auth` package defines generic authentication abstractions that are usable across multiple protocols.
