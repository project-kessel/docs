<Aside title="Under Construction">We are working on improving the documentation</Aside>

This is a guide for the first phase of migration of existing Insights applications from RBACv1 to Kessel.
In this initial phase, the goal is to start using Kessel for authorization enforcement while keeping parity with the current behaviors.
Further “workspacification” (i.e. making assets other than hosts workspace-aware) is out of scope for the initial phase and this guide.

Questions? Please raise them in \#mgmt-fabric-insights-integrations

## Identify the patterns

We start the migration process by identifying the patterns used by our application.
Refer to [KSL-016: Migrating host and organization level permissions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.r4s1xymr6mwu) for more information about the patterns.

Note that an application may fall under more than one of these patterns.
For example, an application may use a combination of:

* permission protecting access to an org-wide setting
* permission protecting access to inventory group aware assets (e.g. host vulnerabilities)

The patterns identified for each application are tracked in [Insights | Kessel Requirements - Service Resource & Permissions Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xfMXqHf3R44L-d9lIXJhl7HfSyf3cN9V35C_nRtTWXQ/edit?gid=1723212125#gid=1723212125)

## Model the permissions

Afterwards, we need to convert permission definitions from [the legacy format](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/tree/master/configs/prod/permissions) to permission definitions expressed using the ksl language.
More information about modeling permissions with the ksl language can be found in [Design permissions schema](/docs/building-with-kessel/how-to/design-permissions/).

Example definition of permissions that follow the [Root workspace pattern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z8kd70uc9ad5) (protecting org-wide settings):

```
version 0.1
namespace config_manager

import rbac

@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'config_manager', resource:'profile', verb:'read', v2_perm:'config_manager_profile_view');
@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'config_manager', resource:'profile', verb:'write', v2_perm:'config_manager_profile_edit');
```

Example definition of permissions that follow the [Native, workspace-level list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.17ytnrwi9six) pattern (protecting patches applicable to a host, which are workspace-aware assets)

```
version 0.1
namespace patch

import rbac
import hbi

@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'patch', resource:'system', verb:'read', v2_perm:'patch_system_view_assigned');
@rbac.add_contingent_permission(first: 'inventory_host_view', second: 'patch_system_view_assigned', contingent: 'patch_system_view');
@hbi.expose_host_permission(v2_perm: 'patch_system_view', host_perm: 'patch_system_view');

@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'patch', resource:'system', verb:'write', v2_perm:'patch_system_edit_assigned');
@rbac.add_contingent_permission(first: 'inventory_host_view', second: 'patch_system_edit_assigned', contingent: 'patch_system_edit');
@hbi.expose_host_permission(v2_perm: 'patch_system_edit', host_perm: 'patch_system_edit');
```

The permission definitions from ksl files are [transpiled into a zed schema](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config?tab=readme-ov-file#building-the-kessel-schema).

<Aside type="tip" title="Tip: Play with the schema">
A good way to understand the resulting schema is by tinkering and evaluating different scenarios and test data is by loading the generated schema into [SpiceDB Playground](https://play.authzed.com/schema).
</Aside>

### Role definitions

Note that the way these permissions are associated with a role remains the same, i.e. via [role files](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/tree/master/configs/prod/roles).

In some cases a completely new permission may be defined in the process of onboarding to Kessel.
In that case, consider defining this permission in RHEL persona-based roles (e.g. RHEL Viewer) in addition to application-specific roles (e.g. Advisor Viewer).
See [RHCLOUD-35891](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHCLOUD-35891) for additional details.


## Implement the changes in the application code

The implementation part typically consists of the following steps:

1. Import the Kessel client library
1. Implement the authorization check in the application code
1. Add tests
1. Add configuration options for the Kessel client

### Importing the client library

Kessel client libraries are available for these languages:

* [Java](https://github.com/project-kessel/inventory-client-java)
* [golang](https://github.com/project-kessel/inventory-client-go)
* [Python](https://github.com/project-kessel/inventory-client-python)

<Aside type="note" title="Why gRPC and not REST?">
In case you are wondering why the Kessel clients use gRPC to communicate with Kessel services instead of REST, take a look at [AUTHZ-005: gRPC vs. REST for platform RBAC Relation API calls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkVii7dU-p86rkj5HA8RXcI4Y3WcMgcoaIFpcigWP3I/edit?tab=t.0)
</Aside>

### Implement the authorization check in the application code

The authorization check is typically implemented at the middleware layer.
The actual implementation differs based on the selected pattern(s).

#### Root/Default workspace pattern

The implementation of [root workspace pattern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z8kd70uc9ad5) and [default workspace pattern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.llalb2knp7t) starts with a lookup of the default/root workspace id for the given organization.

The workspace ID can be obtained from the RBAC service via a REST call:

```
GET /v2/workspaces?type=root
GET /v2/workspaces?type=default
```

The default/root workspace for a given organization is guaranteed to never change and is therefore easily cacheable.
However, in the future the need to look up the default/root workspace ID will be resolved transparently on the Kessel side.
There is therefore no need to implement the caching code in the application code at this time.

With the workspace id resolved, the authorization check call can be made to Kessel.
The actual method called depends on the nature of the operation.

Use [CheckForUpdate](https://buf.build/project-kessel/inventory-api/docs/main:kessel.inventory.v1beta2#kessel.inventory.v1beta2.KesselInventoryService.CheckForUpdate) for performing authorization check for

* any write operations
* highly-sensitive read operations (e.g. access to read credentials for connecting to a customer’s cluster)

In all other cases, use [Check](https://buf.build/project-kessel/inventory-api/docs/main:kessel.inventory.v1beta2#kessel.inventory.v1beta2.KesselInventoryService.Check).

The parameters provided for the Check/CheckForUpdate request for the Root/Default workspace pattern should be structured as follows:

```go
object := &kesselv2.ResourceReference{
	ResourceType: "workspace",
	ResourceId:   defaultOrRootWorkspaceID,
	Reporter: &kesselv2.ReporterReference{
		Type: "rbac",
	},
}

relation = // the permission to check for

subject := &kesselv2.SubjectReference{
	Resource: &kesselv2.ResourceReference{
		ResourceType: "principal",
		ResourceId:   fmt.Sprintf("redhat/%s", principalID),
		Reporter: &kesselv2.ReporterReference{
			Type: "rbac",
		},
	},
}
```

<Aside type="note" title="Supporting all principal types">
Note that the principalID will differ based on the type of the principal:

* user principal \- `identity.User.UserId`
* service account \- `identity.ServiceAccount.UserId`
</Aside>

* [Resource Optimization Service](https://github.com/josejulio/ros-backend/pull/1/files)
* [Advisor](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ahenning/advisor-backend/-/blob/8fadd8565f4445f9cfa2392708bc0b3accfaf7f0/api/advisor/api/permissions.py#L325)

See [Default workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.llalb2knp7t) for additional information.

#### Native, workspace-level list

The [Native, workspace-level list pattern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.17ytnrwi9six) is typically implemented by resolving the ids of all the workspaces for which the given principal possesses the given permission and then using these workspace ids to filter the assets in application database query.

The workspace ids are obtained using the [StreamedListObjects](https://buf.build/project-kessel/inventory-api/docs/main:kessel.inventory.v1beta2#kessel.inventory.v1beta2.KesselInventoryService.StreamedListObjects) method and its parameters should be defined as follows:

```go
objectType := &kesselv2.RepresentationType{
	ResourceType: "workspace",
	ReporterType: "rbac",
},

relation = // the permission to check for

subject := &kesselv2.SubjectReference{
	Resource: &kesselv2.ResourceReference{
		ResourceType: "principal",
		ResourceId:   fmt.Sprintf("redhat/%s", principalID),
		Reporter: &kesselv2.ReporterReference{
			Type: "rbac",
		},
	},
}
```

<Aside type="note" title="Supporting all principal types">
Note that the principalID will differ based on the type of the principal:

* user principal \- `identity.User.UserId`
* service account \- `identity.ServiceAccount.UserId`

### Adding tests

TBD

[Example of a testcase for Kessel integration](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/config-manager/blob/a937c5f283fb3acb2931cf2713173f220cd1bd11/internal/http/middleware/authorization/kessel_test.go)

### Add configuration options for the Kessel client

The application should add the following configuration options for Kessel:

* `KESSEL_ENABLED`
* `KESSEL_URL`
* `KESSEL_AUTH_ENABLED`
* `KESSEL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`
* `KESSEL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `KESSEL_AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER`
* `KESSEL_INSECURE`

The ClowdApp template should also be updated accordingly to enable environment-specific configuration.
See [Config Manager’s configuration](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/config-manager/pull/242/commits/a937c5f283fb3acb2931cf2713173f220cd1bd11#diff-55823110ec960277fef2e07ee7d7c8f310baff0bd789e5b27160a1ccb6b4a81e) for an example.
