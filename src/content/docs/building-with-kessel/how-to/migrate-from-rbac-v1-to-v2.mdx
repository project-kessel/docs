<Aside title="Under Construction">We are working on improving the documentation</Aside>

This is a guide for the first phase of migration of existing Insights applications from RBACv1 to Kessel.
In this initial phase, the goal is to start using Kessel for authorization enforcement while keeping parity with the current behaviors.
Further “workspacification” (i.e. making assets other than hosts workspace-aware) is out of scope for the initial phase and this guide.

Questions? Please raise them in \#mgmt-fabric-insights-integrations

## Identify the patterns

We start the migration process by identifying the patterns used by our application.
The patterns should be identified individually for each asset type managed by the application.
Different asset types may fall under different patterns and hence an application may use a combination of patterns.
For example, an application may use a combination of:

* permission protecting access to an org-wide setting
* permission protecting access to inventory group aware assets (e.g. host vulnerabilities)

The following patterns are supported:
* [Native](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fxctn4xy427v)
* [Native, workspace-level list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.17ytnrwi9six)
* [Default workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.llalb2knp7t)
* [Root workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z8kd70uc9ad5)
* [Organization-level](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.622lk0gd5b8p)

For the initial migration of RBACv1 applications to Kessel, the following simplified decision tree can be used to identify the appropriate pattern:
* Is the asset related to a host (vulnerability, advisory, compliance report, etc.) and the service already workspace-aware? Use [Native, workspace-level list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.17ytnrwi9six)
* Can the resource be conceptualized as an "asset" (customer manages CRUD; we can imagine it as being placed in a Workspace)? --> Use [Default workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.llalb2knp7t)
* Is the resource "the organization" as a whole (e.g. managing an organization-wide setting) and the operation is "asset-centric" (we could imagine it being Workspace level in the future)? --> Use [Root workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z8kd70uc9ad5)
* Is the resource "the organization" as a whole (e.g. managing an organization-wide setting) and the operation is not "asset-centric" (would never belong at a Workspace level)? --> Use [Organization-level](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.622lk0gd5b8p)

See the Pattern Summary section in [KSL-016: Migrating host and organization level permissions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.dtb0qssiad9s) for more information about the patterns.

The patterns identified for each application are tracked in [Management Fabric Integrations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V3mH2pDgXOcxeyxt0fH8RnzzmDsKRDxKzDxxmuaP1mk/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

## Model the permissions

Afterwards, we need to convert permission definitions from [the legacy RBACv1 format](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/tree/master/configs/prod/permissions) to permission definitions expressed using the ksl language.
These permission definitions are stored in `.ksl` files in the [rbac-config](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/tree/master/configs/stage/schemas/src) repository.

The `@rbac.add_v1_based_permission()` extension simplifies the process of converting the legacy RBACv1 permission definitions to Kessel permissions by incorporating support for wildcard permissions.

<Aside type="note" title="Wildcard permissions">
In RBACv1, wildcard permissions are used to grant access to all resources of a given resource type (`config_manager:*:read`), all operations on a given resource type (`config_manager:profile:*`), or a combination of both (`config_manager:*:*`).
When using RBACv1 for access control, the wildcard permissions need to be evaluated (in addition to the specific permissions) on the client (application) side.

With Kessel, the wildcard permissions can be implemented natively on the Kessel side.
The `@rbac.add_v1_based_permission` extension adds the following permissions to the Kessel schema:

* a Kessel equivalent of the RBACv1 permission - e.g. `config_manager_profile_read` for `config_manager:profile:read`
* all wildcard permutations of the permission - `config_manager_profile_all`, `config_manager_all_read`, `config_manager_all_all`, `all_all_all` (`all` is used instead of `*` in Kessel)
* a compound permission (`config_manager_profile_view`) that combines the permissions above in the following way (metalanguage used for illustration purposes):
  ```
  config_manager_profile_view = config_manager_profile_read OR config_manager_profile_all OR config_manager_all_read OR config_manager_all_all OR all_all_all
  ```

The compound permission should be used to check for access to the resource.


</Aside>


The following rules apply to the `@rbac.add_v1_based_permission()` extension:

* The `app` parameter should be the name of the application.
* The `resource` parameter should be the **singular** name of the resource type.
* The `verb` parameter should be the the verb.
* The `v2_perm` parameter should be the name of the compound permission in Kessel. Note that the last segment of the v2 permission name will differ from the verb of the v1 permission. The following naming convention should be used:
  * `read` -> `view`
  * `write` -> `edit`

Example of a permission definition using the `@rbac.add_v1_based_permission()` extension:
```
version 0.1
namespace config_manager

import rbac

@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'config_manager', resource:'profile', verb:'read', v2_perm:'config_manager_profile_view');
@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'config_manager', resource:'profile', verb:'write', v2_perm:'config_manager_profile_edit');
```

### Permissions that apply to host-centric assets

Certain RBACv1 permissions apply to host-centric assets.
These permissions are typically used to protect access to host-specific data, such as host vulnerabilities, advisories, etc.

In RBACv1, these permissions are evaluated in conjunction with the `inventory:host:read` permission, which can be restricted to specific workspaces (inventory groups) using attribute filters.

In Kessel, this logic can be implemented natively by combining the compound permission with the `inventory:host:read` permission.
The `rbac.add_contingent_permission()` extension simplifies this process.

```
@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'patch', resource:'system', verb:'read', v2_perm:'patch_system_view_assigned');
@rbac.add_contingent_permission(first: 'inventory_host_view', second: 'patch_system_view_assigned', contingent: 'patch_system_view');
```

which is equivalent to (metalanguage used for illustration purposes):

```
patch_system_view_assigned = patch_system_read OR patch_system_all OR patch_system_all_read OR patch_system_all_all OR all_all_all
patch_system_view = inventory_host_view AND patch_system_view_assigned
```

Notice that the `_assigned` suffix is used for the compound permission, which distinguishes it from the contingent permission that incorporates the inventory permission and which should be used for access checks.

Full example:
```
version 0.1
namespace patch

import rbac
import hbi

@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'patch', resource:'system', verb:'read', v2_perm:'patch_system_view_assigned');
@rbac.add_contingent_permission(first: 'inventory_host_view', second: 'patch_system_view_assigned', contingent: 'patch_system_view');
@hbi.expose_host_permission(v2_perm: 'patch_system_view', host_perm: 'patch_system_view');

@rbac.add_v1_based_permission(app:'patch', resource:'system', verb:'write', v2_perm:'patch_system_edit_assigned');
@rbac.add_contingent_permission(first: 'inventory_host_view', second: 'patch_system_edit_assigned', contingent: 'patch_system_edit');
@hbi.expose_host_permission(v2_perm: 'patch_system_edit', host_perm: 'patch_system_edit');
```
<Aside type="tip" title="Tip: Play with the schema">
A good way to understand the resulting schema is by tinkering and evaluating different scenarios and test data is by [transpiling the ksl files into a zed schema](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config?tab=readme-ov-file#building-the-kessel-schema) and loading it into [SpiceDB Playground](https://play.authzed.com/schema).
</Aside>

### Checking in the permission definitions

Once the `.ksl` file(s) are ready, they need to be added to the [rbac-config](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/tree/master) repository by opening a PR.
Note that a separate config exists for each environment ([stage](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/tree/master/configs/stage), [prod](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/tree/master/configs/prod)), allowing the change to be tested in stage before being released to prod.

There is no need to include the modified zed schema in the PR as an automated job will transpile the new/modified ksl files into a zed schema.

### Role definitions

Note that the way these permissions are associated with a role remains the same, i.e. via [role files](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/tree/master/configs/prod/roles).

In some cases a completely new permission may be defined in the process of onboarding to Kessel.
In that case, consider defining this permission in RHEL persona-based roles (e.g. RHEL Viewer) in addition to application-specific roles (e.g. Advisor Viewer).
See [RHCLOUD-35891](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHCLOUD-35891) for additional details.


## Implement the changes in the application code

The implementation part typically consists of the following steps:

1. Import the Kessel client library
1. Implement the authorization check in the application code
1. Add tests
1. Add configuration options for the Kessel client

### Importing the client library

Kessel client libraries are available for these languages:

* [Java](https://github.com/project-kessel/inventory-client-java)
* [golang](https://github.com/project-kessel/kessel-sdk-go)
* [Python](https://github.com/project-kessel/kessel-sdk-py)
* [Node](https://github.com/project-kessel/kessel-sdk-node)
* [Ruby](https://github.com/project-kessel/kessel-sdk-ruby)

<Aside type="note" title="Why gRPC and not REST?">
In case you are wondering why the Kessel clients use gRPC to communicate with Kessel services instead of REST, take a look at [AUTHZ-005: gRPC vs. REST for platform RBAC Relation API calls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkVii7dU-p86rkj5HA8RXcI4Y3WcMgcoaIFpcigWP3I/edit?tab=t.0)
</Aside>

### Implement the authorization check in the application code

The authorization check is typically implemented at the middleware layer.
The actual implementation differs based on the selected pattern(s).

#### Root/Default workspace pattern

The implementation of [root workspace pattern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z8kd70uc9ad5) and [default workspace pattern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.llalb2knp7t) starts with a lookup of the default/root workspace id for the given organization.

The workspace ID can be obtained from the RBAC service via a REST call:

```
GET /v2/workspaces?type=root
GET /v2/workspaces?type=default
```

The default/root workspace for a given organization is guaranteed to never change and is therefore easily cacheable.
However, in the future the need to look up the default/root workspace ID will be resolved transparently on the Kessel side.
There is therefore no need to implement the caching code in the application code at this time.

With the workspace id resolved, the authorization check call can be made to Kessel.
The actual method called depends on the nature of the operation.

Use [CheckForUpdate](https://buf.build/project-kessel/inventory-api/docs/main:kessel.inventory.v1beta2#kessel.inventory.v1beta2.KesselInventoryService.CheckForUpdate) for performing authorization check for

* any write operations
* highly-sensitive read operations (e.g. access to read credentials for connecting to a customer’s cluster)

In all other cases, use [Check](https://buf.build/project-kessel/inventory-api/docs/main:kessel.inventory.v1beta2#kessel.inventory.v1beta2.KesselInventoryService.Check).

The parameters provided for the Check/CheckForUpdate request for the Root/Default workspace pattern should be structured as follows:

```go
object := &kesselv2.ResourceReference{
	ResourceType: "workspace",
	ResourceId:   defaultOrRootWorkspaceID,
	Reporter: &kesselv2.ReporterReference{
		Type: "rbac",
	},
}

relation = // the permission to check for

subject := &kesselv2.SubjectReference{
	Resource: &kesselv2.ResourceReference{
		ResourceType: "principal",
		ResourceId:   fmt.Sprintf("redhat/%s", principalID),
		Reporter: &kesselv2.ReporterReference{
			Type: "rbac",
		},
	},
}
```

<Aside type="note" title="Supporting all principal types">
Note that the principalID will differ based on the type of the principal:

* user principal \- `identity.User.UserId`
* service account \- `identity.ServiceAccount.UserId`
</Aside>

* [Resource Optimization Service](https://github.com/josejulio/ros-backend/pull/1/files)
* [Advisor](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ahenning/advisor-backend/-/blob/8fadd8565f4445f9cfa2392708bc0b3accfaf7f0/api/advisor/api/permissions.py#L325)

See [Default workspace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.llalb2knp7t) for additional information.

#### Native, workspace-level list

The [Native, workspace-level list pattern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XnINsHuYeHEi22q_1cS0gUalX-eXl3V19gGf0Wr8NsE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.17ytnrwi9six) is typically implemented by resolving the ids of all the workspaces for which the given principal possesses the given permission and then using these workspace ids to filter the assets in application database query.

The workspace ids are obtained using the [StreamedListObjects](https://buf.build/project-kessel/inventory-api/docs/main:kessel.inventory.v1beta2#kessel.inventory.v1beta2.KesselInventoryService.StreamedListObjects) method and its parameters should be defined as follows:

```go
objectType := &kesselv2.RepresentationType{
	ResourceType: "workspace",
	ReporterType: "rbac",
},

relation = // the permission to check for

subject := &kesselv2.SubjectReference{
	Resource: &kesselv2.ResourceReference{
		ResourceType: "principal",
		ResourceId:   fmt.Sprintf("redhat/%s", principalID),
		Reporter: &kesselv2.ReporterReference{
			Type: "rbac",
		},
	},
}
```

<Aside type="note" title="Supporting all principal types">
Note that the principalID will differ based on the type of the principal:

* user principal \- `identity.User.UserId`
* service account \- `identity.ServiceAccount.UserId`

### Adding tests

TBD

[Example of a testcase for Kessel integration](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/config-manager/blob/a937c5f283fb3acb2931cf2713173f220cd1bd11/internal/http/middleware/authorization/kessel_test.go)

### Add configuration options for the Kessel client

The application should add the following configuration options for Kessel:

* `KESSEL_ENABLED`
* `KESSEL_URL`
* `KESSEL_AUTH_ENABLED`
* `KESSEL_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`
* `KESSEL_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `KESSEL_AUTH_OIDC_ISSUER`
* `KESSEL_INSECURE`

The ClowdApp template should also be updated accordingly to enable environment-specific configuration.
See [Config Manager’s configuration](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/config-manager/pull/242/commits/a937c5f283fb3acb2931cf2713173f220cd1bd11#diff-55823110ec960277fef2e07ee7d7c8f310baff0bd789e5b27160a1ccb6b4a81e) for an example.

## Validate the changes in the ephemeral environment

The following section describes how to deploy Kessel and related services in an ephemeral environment and use them to validate the changes made to an integrating application.

### Deploying Kessel and related services

[insights-service-deployer](https://github.com/project-kessel/insights-service-deployer/tree/main) should be used to deploy Kessel and other related services in an ephemeral environment.
Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/project-kessel/insights-service-deployer/blob/main/README.md) to reserve a namespace and set up the environment variables and then run the following command to deploy Kessel and related services and seed them with sample data:

	```shell
	./deploy.sh deploy_with_hbi_demo
	```

### Enabling authentication

Applications using Kessel for access control need to authenticate with Kessel and RBAC in stage/prod environments.
The following steps enable authentication with Kessel so that it can be validated in the ephemeral environment.

1. Navigate to [Identity & Access Management in Stage](https://console.stage.redhat.com/iam/service-accounts) to create a new service account and obtain the client ID and client secret.
   This is a service account that our application will use to authenticate with Kessel and RBAC.

1. Start a new shell and store the client ID and client secret as environment variables:

	```shell
	CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
	CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
	```

1. Next, we need to determine the subject (`sub` claim) for the service account:

	```shell
	SUB=$(curl -s https://sso.stage.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token -d grant_type=client_credentials -d client_id=${CLIENT_ID} -d client_secret=${CLIENT_SECRET} | jq -r '.access_token' | awk -F. '{print $2}' | base64 --decode 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.sub')
	```

1. Now, we'll update the configuration of the RBAC service to enable authentication.
   With the RBAC service running in the ephemeral environment (see steps above), run the following command to grant unlimited access to the service account created in the first step:

	```shell
	oc create secret generic system-users --dry-run=client -o yaml --from-literal="system-users.json={
	\"$SUB\": {
		\"admin\": true,
		\"is_service_account\": true,
		\"allow_any_org\": true
	}
	}" | kubectl apply -f -
	```

1. Next, reconfigure the RBAC service to validate access tokens using Stage SSO:

	```shell
	oc get clowdapp rbac -o json | \
		jq '(.spec.deployments[] | select(.name=="service") | .podSpec.env[] | select(.name=="IT_BYPASS_TOKEN_VALIDATION") | .value) = "False" |
		(.spec.deployments[] | select(.name=="service") | .podSpec.env[] | select(.name=="IT_SERVICE_HOST") | .value) = "sso.stage.redhat.com"' | \
		oc apply -f -
	```

1. Furthermore, we also need to update the Kessel Inventory service configuration to enable authentication.
   Run `oc edit cm inventory-api-config` to edit the kessel-inventory configuration ConfigMap and in the editor update the authn section like this:

	```yaml
	    authn:
	      oidc:
	        authn-server-url: https://sso.stage.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external
	        client-id: foo
	        skip-client-id-check: true
	        insecure-client: false
	```


1. Finally, restart the Kessel service:

	```shell
	oc delete pod -l pod=kessel-inventory-api
	```

### Forwarding ports for local development

With Kessel running in the ephemeral environment, you can forward the ports to enable the application running locally to connect to RBAC and Kessel.

1. Use `oc port-forward svc/rbac-service 8000:8000` to forward port 8000 to the RBAC service
1. Use `oc port-forward svc/kessel-inventory-api 9091:9000` to forward port 9091 to the Kessel Inventory service

With port forwarding running, you can now configure your application to use the local Kessel and RBAC ports and start it.

For example, for Config Manager, the command to configure and run the application looks like this:

```shell
go run main.go --log-level trace --kessel-enabled=true --kessel-url=localhost:9091 --kessel-auth-enabled=true --kessel-auth-client-id=${CLIENT_ID} --kessel-auth-client-secret=${CLIENT_SECRET} --kessel-auth-oidc-issuer=https://sso.stage.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external --rbac-url=http://localhost:8000 http-api
```


## Deploy the changes

Follow [Using Kessel in production](https://project-kessel.github.io/docs-internal/using-kessel/in-production) to set up your service to use Kessel in stage and prod.
