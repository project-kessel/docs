## Using an Outbox
Writing to your database and publishing events to a message broker are two distinct operations on external systems that
cannot happen in an atomic manner (aka Dual Write Problem). This means that if your application crashes after writing
to the database but before publishing an asynchronous event, your database and any message consumers may become
permanently out of sync. The outbox pattern helps solve this problem by writing resource aggregates and messaging events
within the same database transaction using an outbox table. When coupled with something like
[Debezium](https://debezium.io/), the outbox table can be used to publish events to a message broker, ensuring that the
database and messages are always (eventually) in sync.

### The Outbox Table

This example uses the same structure as the [Debezium Outbox Event Router](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/transformations/outbox-event-router.html#basic-outbox-table) example.

```sql
CREATE TABLE outbox (
    id UUID NOT NULL,
    aggregatetype VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    aggregateid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

**Column Breakdown:**

- **id:** A unique identifier for each event, your primary key
- **aggregatetype:** Describes the type of business entity that an event relates to, for example, customer or order.
  This is used by Debezium to determine the destination topic.
- **aggregateid:** The unique identifier of the specific entity instance, like the customer's ID or order number.
- **payload:** The actual content of the event message, typically stored as JSON or JSONB for flexibility. This is what
  message consumers will receive.

Additional columns can be added as needed, such as a `timestamp` for event creation or `operation` to indicate the type
of operation (e.g., create, update, delete). There are [additional configurations](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/transformations/outbox-event-router.html#emitting-messages-with-additional-fields)
that need to be added to the debezium configuration if you'd like these fields to be mapped to headers or the payload
when producing messages.

### Writing to the Outbox

With the outbox table in place, you'll need to modify your application's business logic to write to it within the same
transaction as your primary data changes.

For example, if you're creating a new customer and want to publish an event about it, you could consider your
transaction looking something like this:

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO customers (id, name) VALUES ('123', 'John Doe');
INSERT INTO outbox (id, aggregatetype, aggregateid, payload)
VALUES ('456', 'customer', '123', '{"event": "customer_created", "data": {"id": "123", "name": "John Doe"}}');
COMMIT;
```

This ensures that both the customer record and the outbox event are created atomically. If the transaction fails, neither the customer nor the outbox entry will be written, maintaining consistency between your business entity data and downstream consumers.

### Culling the Outbox

To prevent the outbox table from growing indefinitely, you will need to implement a cleanup strategy.

With Debezium, since it will be reading from the [write-ahead log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html), you can safely delete entries from the outbox table immediately; even within the same transaction that created them.

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO customers (id, name) VALUES ('123', 'John Doe');
INSERT INTO outbox (id, aggregatetype, aggregateid, payload)
  VALUES ('456', 'customer', '123', '{"event": "customer_created", "data": {"id": "123", "name": "John Doe"}}');
DELETE FROM outbox WHERE id = '456';
COMMIT;
```

If you need to retain history for auditing, debugging, or recovery purposes, consider implementing a retention policy or reconciler that archives old events to a separate table, long-term data store, or even delete them entirely.

### Monitoring

**Outbox Event Creation**: Tracking the rate of event creation in combination with the rate of event consumption can help identify end-to-end lag in your system. If the outbox is filling up faster than it can be processed, you may need to scale your consumers or optimize your event processing logic.

See our **Monitoring Data Replication** guide for more details on how to monitor your replication processes.

### Beware: Write Skew

Interleaved database writes could lead to
[write skew issues](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/what-write-skew-looks-like/), where concurrent application
read-modify-write cycles could be operating on stale data causing silent corruption. It's advisable to take this into
consideration when designing your outbox and event processing logic.

## Synchronizing Async Events with Postgres Listen/Notify

For services that will produce asynchronous events downstream from a request handler and subsequently consume them as
apart of their replication pattern, a mechanism may be needed to signal when the event processing is complete. This
allows the initial request handler to wait for the outcome of the event consumption (e.g. replicating to kessel) before
proceeding or returning to the client. Postgres's [LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html)/[NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html)
features provide a lightweight solution for this synchronization.

### How it works

The process is fairly straightforward:

* **Produce & Listen:** The request handler produces an event to a Kafka topic (directly or via an outbox table) and then begins LISTENing on a Postgres channel.
* **Consume & Notify:** A separate consumer process parses the event. Upon completion, it issues a NOTIFY command to the same channel the request handler is listening on.
* **Synchronize:** The LISTENing request handler receives this notification, confirming that the event has been successfully consumed. This allows the handler to then continue its execution, for example, by returning a response to the client.

This approach effectively creates a synchronous workflow over an asynchronous workflow, ensuring that request handlers can await the completion of downstream event processing.

### Examples

#### Listening on a Postgres channel
To listen for notifications on a specific Postgres channel, you can use the `LISTEN` command. The example below listens
on the `host-replication` channel. Channels are arbitrarily defined strings that you can use to group related notifications.
```sql
LISTEN "host-replication";
```

#### Notifying a Postgres channel
The SQL below sends a notification to all listeners on the `host-replication` channel. The payload can be any string,
but in this example, it is a UUID that could be used to identify the specific event or request.
```sql
NOTIFY "host-replication", 'c0740fcd-c2a3-4767-b2d2-fd21cd12e31a';
```

### Considerations
- LISTEN/NOTIFY may not be supported by all database drivers, you should double-check that your current postgres driver
can handle it.
- Postgres channels are not durable, meaning that if the request handler is not actively listening when the NOTIFY is
sent, it will miss the notification. Listening should be one of the first things you do in your request handler.
- Postgres channels are not meant to be ephemeral, so you should not create and drop channels frequently. Instead, use a
 consistent channel name for each type of event you want to listen for. This means that you may have many listeners on
 the same channel and your event/notification payloads should have some identifier to distinguish which event the
 listener is interested in.
- LISTEN/NOTIFY should use it's own pg connection, separate from the one used for your application logic. This is
because LISTEN/NOTIFY is a long-lived operation that can block other operations on the same connection. You should also
aim to minimize connections in a way that each new LISTEN does not produce a new connection, but rather reuses an
existing one.

## Kafka Consumer Strategies
As a service provider, you need a reliable way to replicate data changes from your systems to the Fabric. 
A Kafka consumer offers a robust and scalable pattern to solve this problem. A consumer reads messages from Kafka topics by subscribing to topic partitions. 
The consuming application then processes the messages to apply those changes.

This guide outlines the key challenges your consumer should address and provides
some high-level strategies for building a robust solution.

We built our consumer in Go using the [confluent-kafka-go](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go) client library.

### Why Use a Kafka Consumer for Replication?
When replicating data, a Kafka consumer solves the core problem of reliably processing asynchronous messages.
It decouples your primary service from the replication process, meaning an issue in the replication pipeline won't 
directly impact your main application's performance.

### Key Guarantees for Data Integrity
To maintain data consistency between your service and the management fabric, your consumer implementation 
should prioritize data integrity. Below are three guarantees that we aim to enforce with our own consumer
that you should too.

1. **Messages must be processed in order:**
  If messages are not processed in the order in which they are received we risk applying changes in a manner
  that causes unexpected consequences. For example, processing an `update` event before a `create` event for the 
  same record would fail and cause data issues. 

2. **Guarantee At-least-once processing:**
  A consumer must never "lose" a message. In other words, we should not be continuing 
  to process the next message until the current one has been confirmed to be processed. 
  Without this guarantee we risk losing data and will have permanent inconsistency for the “skipped” event.

3. **Retry indefinitely on failure:**
  Similar to the above, we cannot risk skipping events because it creates a permanent inconsistency.
  Stuck messages that cannot be successfully processed for some reason may require manual intervention 
  but that is more affordable than data integrity issues in an authz system. 

### Authentication
To read from a secured Kafka cluster, a consumer must first authenticate itself with the brokers.
This is configured in the consumer's properties. For our setup we use SASL with the SCRAM-SHA-512 mechanism.

A typical configuration would look like this:
```yaml
security-protocol: sasl_plaintext
sasl-mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
sasl-username: my-generic-consumer
sasl-password: <PASSWORD>
```

Your consumer configuration must include properties like `security.protocol`, `sasl.mechanism`, 
and other related settings to provide the necessary credentials for a successful connection to Kafka.

### Retry Logic
Message processing can fail for many reasons. Some failures are transient (e.g. a temporary network failure), 
while others are permanent (e.g. a malformed message). A robust consumer must handle these failures without halting all
processing.

Our implementation uses two retry systems to handle message failures, prioritizing 
message durability over pure throughput.

1. **Operation-level Retry:**
For transient failures within a specific task, a blocking `Retry` function is used.

```go
// Retry executes the given function and will retry on failure with backoff until max retries is reached
func (i *InventoryConsumer) Retry(operation func() (string, error)) (string, error) {
    // ...
    for i.RetryOptions.OperationMaxRetries == -1 || attempts < i.RetryOptions.OperationMaxRetries {
        resp, err = operation()
        if err != nil {
            // ... logs error, increments metric
            time.Sleep(backoff) // Blocks here
            continue
        }
        return fmt.Sprintf("%s", resp), nil
    }
    // ...
}
```
This function synchronously retries a failing operation with an exponential backoff up to a configured maximum. 
Because it uses `time.Sleep`, it blocks the consumer's main processing loop. 

2. **Consumer-Level Retry:**
If a message fails processing in a way that the Consume loop cannot recover from (indicated by `consumer.ErrClosed`),
a more drastic retry strategy is engaged.

```go
// Outer consumer loop
for consumerOptions.RetryOptions.ConsumerMaxRetries == -1 || retries < consumerOptions.RetryOptions.ConsumerMaxRetries {
    // ... recreates the entire consumer connection
    inventoryConsumer, err = consumer.New(...)
    err = inventoryConsumer.Consume()
    if e.Is(err, consumer.ErrClosed) {
        // ... backs off and retries by re-entering the loop
        continue
    }
    // ...
}
```

This strategy ensures a failed message is re-attempted from scratch by forcing a re-read from the last
committed offset, preventing potential message loss.

### Rebalances
Rebalances are critical to handle, as if your consumer loses a partition without first saving its progress
the next consumer will start processing from the last saved point, leading to duplicate processing.

Our consumer handles partition reassignments from the Kafka cluster by registering a `RebalanceCallback`. This
ensures its processing state is committed before partitions are lost.
```go
func (i *InventoryConsumer) RebalanceCallback(consumer *kafka.Consumer, event kafka.Event) error {
    switch ev := event.(type) {
    // ...
    case kafka.RevokedPartitions:
        i.Logger.Warnf("consumer rebalance event: %d partition(s) revoked: %v\n",
            len(ev.Partitions), ev.Partitions)

        // Commits stored offsets before partition is lost
        err := i.commitStoredOffsets() 
        // ...
    }
    return nil
}
``` 
When the consumer is notified that it is about to lose ownership of its partitions, it calls `commitStoredOffsets()`. This
is essential to guarantee that all successfully processed messages before this point have been marked as complete.
This prevents the next consumer that receives the partition from reprocessing messages, maintaining the at-least-once
processing guarantee.


### Leveraging Client Statistics
In addition to application level metrics (e.g. "events processed"), most Kafka client libraries
can be configured to emit internal performance statistics, often as JSON. These "stats messages" provide a deep, 
real-time view into the health and performance of the consumer client itself. 

To enable this you typically set a configuration property like `statistics.interval.ms` to a non-zero value 
(e.g. 60000 for every 60 seconds). The client will then periodically provide a detailed report containing metrics such as:

- **Round-trip time (rtt)** 
- **Total messages consumed (rxmsgs)** 

These stats messages metrics are invaluable for debugging. You can use these metrics in dashboards and alerts we offer
or build your own to track the health of the consumer. 

### Deployment 
How you deploy your consumer has a few key considerations, with 3 main ways to do so.

1. **In-process thread (used by the Kessel team)**
  - Consumer logic runs as a thread within the main application process.
  - Simple to deploy and manage without any network overhead for communication.
  - Tightly coupled resources. A CPU and memory intensive task in the main application can
  starve the consumer thread and vice versa. 
  - Cannot scale the consumer independently from the main application.
2. **Sidecar container**
  - Consumer logic runs in its own container within the same pod as the main application.
  - Decouples resources. The consumer and application have their own CPU and memory limits.
  - Allows for independent scaling and focused monitoring and logging. 
  - Higher operational complexity than an in-process thread. Communication between the application
  and consumer incurs some network overhead.  
3. **Standalone pod** 
  - Consumer logic runs as a completely separate deployment/service.
  - Maximum decoupling of resources, scaling, and lifecycle.
  - Highest operational complexity. Requires a separate deployment definition, monitoring, and alerting setup.
  - Can be overkill if the consumer's logic is tightly coupled to the domain of a single application.
