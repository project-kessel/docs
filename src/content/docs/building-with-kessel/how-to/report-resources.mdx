## Using an Outbox
Writing to your database and publishing events to a message broker are two distinct operations on external systems that
cannot happen in an atomic manner (aka Dual Write Problem). This means that if your application crashes after writing 
to the database but before publishing an asynchronous event, your database and any message consumers may become 
permanently out of sync. The outbox pattern helps solve this problem by writing resource aggregates and messaging events
within the same database transaction using an outbox table. When coupled with something like 
[Debezium](https://debezium.io/), the outbox table can be used to publish events to a message broker, ensuring that the
database and messages are always (eventually) in sync.

### The Outbox Table

This example uses the same structure as the [Debezium Outbox Event Router](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/transformations/outbox-event-router.html#basic-outbox-table) example.

```sql
CREATE TABLE outbox (
    id UUID NOT NULL,
    aggregatetype VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    aggregateid VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    payload JSONB,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

**Column Breakdown:**

- **id:** A unique identifier for each event, your primary key
- **aggregatetype:** Describes the type of business entity that an event relates to, for example, customer or order. 
  This is used by Debezium to determine the destination topic.
- **aggregateid:** The unique identifier of the specific entity instance, like the customer's ID or order number.
- **payload:** The actual content of the event message, typically stored as JSON or JSONB for flexibility. This is what 
  message consumers will receive.

Additional columns can be added as needed, such as a `timestamp` for event creation or `operation` to indicate the type
of operation (e.g., create, update, delete). There are [additional configurations](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/transformations/outbox-event-router.html#emitting-messages-with-additional-fields) 
that need to be added to the debezium configuration if you'd like these fields to be mapped to headers or the payload 
when producing messages.

### Writing to the Outbox

With the outbox table in place, you'll need to modify your application's business logic to write to it within the same 
transaction as your primary data changes.

For example, if you're creating a new customer and want to publish an event about it, you could consider your 
transaction looking something like this:

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO customers (id, name) VALUES ('123', 'John Doe');
INSERT INTO outbox (id, aggregatetype, aggregateid, payload)
VALUES ('456', 'customer', '123', '{"event": "customer_created", "data": {"id": "123", "name": "John Doe"}}');
COMMIT;
```

This ensures that both the customer record and the outbox event are created atomically. If the transaction fails, neither the customer nor the outbox entry will be written, maintaining consistency between your business entity data and downstream consumers.

### Culling the Outbox

To prevent the outbox table from growing indefinitely, you will need to implement a cleanup strategy.

With Debezium, since it will be reading from the [write-ahead log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html), you can safely delete entries from the outbox table immediately; even within the same transaction that created them.

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO customers (id, name) VALUES ('123', 'John Doe');
INSERT INTO outbox (id, aggregatetype, aggregateid, payload)
  VALUES ('456', 'customer', '123', '{"event": "customer_created", "data": {"id": "123", "name": "John Doe"}}');
DELETE FROM outbox WHERE id = '456';
COMMIT;
```

If you need to retain history for auditing, debugging, or recovery purposes, consider implementing a retention policy or reconciler that archives old events to a separate table, long-term data store, or even delete them entirely.

### Monitoring

**Outbox Event Creation**: Tracking the rate of event creation in combination with the rate of event consumption can help identify end-to-end lag in your system. If the outbox is filling up faster than it can be processed, you may need to scale your consumers or optimize your event processing logic.

See [Monitoring Replication](/404) for more details on how to monitor your replication processes.

### Beware: Write Skew

Interleaved database writes could lead to 
[write skew issues](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/what-write-skew-looks-like/), where concurrent application 
read-modify-write cycles could be operating on stale data causing silent corruption. It's advisable to take this into 
consideration when designing your outbox and event processing logic.

## Synchronizing Async Events with Postgres Listen/Notify

For services that will produce asynchronous events downstream from a request handler and subsequently consume them as 
apart of their replication pattern, a mechanism may be needed to signal when the event processing is complete. This 
allows the initial request handler to wait for the outcome of the event consumption (e.g. replicating to kessel) before 
proceeding or returning to the client. Postgres's [LISTEN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html)/[NOTIFY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-notify.html) 
features provide a lightweight solution for this synchronization.

### How it works

The process is fairly straightforward:

* **Produce & Listen:** The request handler produces an event to a Kafka topic (directly or via an outbox table) and then begins LISTENing on a Postgres channel.
* **Consume & Notify:** A separate consumer process parses the event. Upon completion, it issues a NOTIFY command to the same channel the request handler is listening on.
* **Synchronize:** The LISTENing request handler receives this notification, confirming that the event has been successfully consumed. This allows the handler to then continue its execution, for example, by returning a response to the client.

This approach effectively creates a synchronous workflow over an asynchronous workflow, ensuring that request handlers can await the completion of downstream event processing.

### Examples

#### Listening on a Postgres channel
To listen for notifications on a specific Postgres channel, you can use the `LISTEN` command. The example below listens 
on the `host-replication` channel. Channels are arbitrarily defined strings that you can use to group related notifications.
```sql
LISTEN "host-replication";
```

#### Notifying a Postgres channel
The SQL below sends a notification to all listeners on the `host-replication` channel. The payload can be any string,
but in this example, it is a UUID that could be used to identify the specific event or request.
```sql
NOTIFY "host-replication", 'c0740fcd-c2a3-4767-b2d2-fd21cd12e31a';
```

### Considerations
- LISTEN/NOTIFY may not be supported by all database drivers, you should double-check that your current postgres driver 
can handle it.
- Postgres channels are not durable, meaning that if the request handler is not actively listening when the NOTIFY is
sent, it will miss the notification. Listening should be one of the first things you do in your request handler.
- Postgres channels are not meant to be ephemeral, so you should not create and drop channels frequently. Instead, use a
 consistent channel name for each type of event you want to listen for. This means that you may have many listeners on 
 the same channel and your event/notification payloads should have some identifier to distinguish which event the 
 listener is interested in.
- LISTEN/NOTIFY should use it's own pg connection, separate from the one used for your application logic. This is 
because LISTEN/NOTIFY is a long-lived operation that can block other operations on the same connection. You should also 
aim to minimize connections in a way that each new LISTEN does not produce a new connection, but rather reuses an 
existing one.
