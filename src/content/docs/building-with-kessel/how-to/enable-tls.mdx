import SdkExamples from 'src/components/SdkExamples.astro';

The Kessel SDKs support TLS for secure communication with Kessel services. 
When deployed in stage and production environments, you'll need to configure both TLS transport credentials and OAuth 2.0 authentication.

## Overview

Setting up TLS with authentication requires three steps:

1. **Configure Transport Credentials** - Load your CA certificate to verify the server
2. **Configure Call Credentials** - Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication
3. **Combine Both** - Use your SDK's builder to apply both credential types

## Kubernetes/OpenShift Deployment

When deploying in Kubernetes or OpenShift, you can mount CA certificates using ConfigMaps:

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - name: ca-certs
    mountPath: "/ca-certs"
volumes:
  - name: ca-certs
    configMap:
      name: openshift-service-ca.crt
```

This mounts the CA certificate at `/ca-certs/service-ca.crt`, which you can reference in your application code.

## Code Examples

Below are complete examples showing how to configure TLS with OAuth 2.0 authentication in each supported language:
